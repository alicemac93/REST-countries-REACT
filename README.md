*Project in making*

This React project aims at importing REST countries via RESTful API. 

- Data is fetched in an useEffect hook to prevent unnecessary API calls with every render. 
- It uses React Context Api to hold the state of the theme, with the toggler button being a component on its on - which helps the reusability of this funcionality. 

to be done: 
 - filter countries based on filter dropdown
 - filtercountries based on Search Bar
   - useRef for input values 
 - create detail views for individual countries 
 - use StyledComponents potentially together with Context API
